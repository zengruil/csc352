/* Expr
 *
 * The Expr struct represents, in a (somewhat) object-oriented way, a numeric
 * expression which resolves to a float.
 *
 * It has two Expr parameters (for the various binary operators), and also a
 * float value, for literals.  It also has a string, which is the original
 * string that we parsed.
 *
 * The most interesting part, however, is that it has a function pointer to
 * give the correct 'eval' method for this object.

	 * the values that it finds as the first two parameters (and zero
	 * as the third).  But if they are NULL, then the student code
